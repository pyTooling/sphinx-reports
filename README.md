# Sphinx Reports

The Sphinx extension `sphinx_reports` offers a set of directives to integrate reports and summaries into the
documentation generated by Sphinx.

Supported format reports are:
* âœ… Documentation coverage (by `docstr_coverage` (or `interrogate`?))
* ðŸš§ Code coverage (by `Coverage.py`)
* ðŸš§ Unit Test summaries (by `pytest`)
* ðŸš§ Dependencies (reading `requirements.txt` files)

## Extension Configuration

This README demonstrates a quick and minimal configuration for the Sphinx extension and it's provided directives. See
the [sphinx-reports documentation](https://pyTooling.github.io/sphinx-reports) for more details.

At first, add the extension name to the list of extensions in `conf.py`, so the extension is loaded by Sphinx.

```Python
# Sphinx extensions
extensions = [
  # ...
  "sphinx_reports",
]
```

Each report directive might require an individual configuration, therefore see the next sections for details.

### Quick Configuration

This is a quick and minimal configuration for the *documentation coverage* directives.
See [documentation coverage](https://pyTooling.github.io/sphinx-reports/DocCov/index.html) documentation for more
details.

1. Configure one or more Python packages for documentation coverage analysis in `conf.py` by adding a new 'section' 
   defining some configuration variables. Each package is identified by an ID, which is later referred to by the report
   directive. Here, the ID is called `src` (dictionary key). Each package needs 4 configuration entries:

   * `name`  
     Name of the Python package[^PkgNameVsPkgDir].
   * `directory`  
     The directory of the package to analyze.
   * `fail_below`  
     An integer value in range 0..100, for when a documentation coverage is considered FAILED.
   * `levels`  
     A dictionary of coverage limits, their description and CSS style classes.

   ```Python
   # ==============================================================================
   # Sphinx-reports - DocCov
   # ==============================================================================
   report_doccov_packages = {
     "src": {
       "name":       "myPackage",
       "directory":  "../myPackage",
       "fail_below": 80,
       "levels": {
         30:  {"class": "doccov-below30",  "desc": "almost undocumented"},
         50:  {"class": "doccov-below50",  "desc": "poorly documented"},
         80:  {"class": "doccov-below80",  "desc": "roughly documented"},
         90:  {"class": "doccov-below90",  "desc": "well documented"},
         100: {"class": "doccov-below100", "desc": "excellent documented"},
       },
     }
   }
   ```
2. Add the `doc-coverage` directive into your Restructured Text (ReST) document.
   
   * `packageid`  
     The ID used in `conf.py` to describe a Python package.
   * `legend` (optional)  
     Position of the legend (`NoLegend`, `Top`, `Bottom`, `Both`)

   ```Python
   .. report:doc-coverage::
      :packageid: src
   ```

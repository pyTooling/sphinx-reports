# Sphinx Reports

The Sphinx extension `sphinx_reports` offers a set of directives to integrate reports and summaries into the
documentation generated by Sphinx.

Supported format reports are:
* ‚úÖüöß Unit Test summaries (by [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest))
  * ‚úÖ Summary page (displaying `unittest.xml`)
  * üöß Show logging, output and error messages.
* üöß Code coverage (by [Coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy))
  * ‚úÖ Summary page (displaying `coverage.json`)
  * üöß Individual Sphinx documents per package/module
  * üöß Highlighted source code with syntax highlighting and coverage highlighting
* üöß Documentation coverage
  * ‚úÖ Summary page (displaying data from ["""docstr_coverage"""](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/docstr_coverage))
  * ‚ùì Additionally support [interrogate](https://github.com/econchick/interrogate) as data source.
  * üöß Individual Sphinx documents per package/module
  * üöß Highlighted source code with syntax highlighting and coverage highlighting 
* üöß Package Dependencies
  * üöß Summary page (displaying `requirements.txt`)


## Extension Configuration

This README demonstrates a quick and minimal configuration for the Sphinx extension and it's provided directives. See
the [sphinx-reports documentation](https://pyTooling.github.io/sphinx-reports) for more details.

At first, add the extension name to the list of extensions in `conf.py`, so the extension is loaded by Sphinx.

```Python
# Sphinx extensions
extensions = [
  # ...
  "sphinx_reports",
]
```

Each report directive might require an individual configuration, therefore see the next sections for details.


## Unittest Report Summary

The *Unittests Report* collects the success or failure of unittests. The results are typically stored in an XML file,
which can be read by **sphinx-reports**. After reading the structure of testsuites and testcases, the report can be
visualized. The user

This is a quick and minimal configuration for the *unittest summary* directives.
See the [unittest](https://pyTooling.github.io/sphinx-reports/Unittest/index.html) documentation for more details.

<details><summary>Quick Configuration - Step-by-Step</summary>

1. Configure one or more coverage analysis reports in `conf.py` by adding a new 'section' defining some configuration
   variables. Each unittest report is identified by an ID, which is later referred to by the report directive. Here, the
   ID is called ``src`` (dictionary key). Each unittest report needs 1 configuration entry:

   * `xml_report` - The unittest report as XML file as generated by *pytest*.

   ```Python
   report_unittest_testsuites = {
     "src": {
       "xml_report": "../report/unit/unittest.xml"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Add the `unittest-summary` directive into your Restructured Text (ReST) document.

   * `reportid` - The ID used in `conf.py` to describe a report.

   ```ReST
   .. report:unittest-summary::
      :reportid: src
   ```

</details>

## Code Coverage Summary

*Code Coverage* checks if a source code was used during execution. Usually, testcases are run by a testcase execution
framework like [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest), which also offers to instrument the code for code
coverage collection using the `pytest-cov` plugin. For Python, coverage collection is usually based on
[Coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy>), which supports statement and branch coverage collection either as
XML or JSON files. **sphinx-reports** can visualize a code coverage summary from JSON files. 

![Code Coverage Summary Page](doc/_static/CodeCoverage.png)


This is a quick and minimal configuration for the *code coverage* directives.
See the [code coverage](https://pyTooling.github.io/sphinx-reports/CodeCov/index.html) documentation for more details.

<details><summary>Quick Configuration - Step-by-Step</summary>

1. Configure one or more coverage analysis reports in `conf.py` by adding a new 'section' defining some configuration
   variables. Each analysis report is identified by an ID, which is later referred to by the report directive. Here, the
   ID is called ``src`` (dictionary key). Each analysis report needs 4 configuration entries:

   * `name` - Name of the Python package[^1].
   * `json_report` - The code coverage report as JSON file as generated by *Coverage.py*.
   * `fail_below` - An integer value in range 0..100, for when a code coverage is considered FAILED.
   * `levels` - A predefined color pallet name or a dictionary of coverage limits, their description and CSS style classes.

   ```Python
   # ==============================================================================
   # Sphinx-reports - CodeCov
   # ==============================================================================
   report_codecov_packages = {
     "src": {
       "name":        "myPackage",
       "json_report": "../report/coverage/coverage.json",
       "fail_below":  80,
       "levels":      "default"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Add the `code-coverage` directive into your Restructured Text (ReST) document.

   * `packageid` - The ID used in `conf.py` to describe a Python package.

   ```ReST
   .. report:code-coverage::
      :packageid: src
   ```

</details>


## Documentation Coverage Summary

*Documentation Coverage* counts how many publicly accessible members are documented using a Python *doc-string*. Based
on the count of possibly documented public members and the actual number of non-empty *doc-strings*, a percentage of
documentation coverage can be computed.

Documentation coverage is a measure of code quality, which expresses how well documented (completeness or documentation,
but not necessarily quality/helpfulness of documentation) source code is. Well documented code helps to use and maintain
the existing code base. It also allows for automated documentation generation.

![Documentation Coverage Summary Page](doc/_static/DocCoverage.png)


This is a quick and minimal configuration for the *documentation coverage* directives.
See the [documentation coverage](https://pyTooling.github.io/sphinx-reports/DocCov/index.html) documentation for more
details.

<details><summary>Quick Configuration - Step-by-Step</summary>

1. Configure one or more Python packages for documentation coverage analysis in `conf.py` by adding a new 'section' 
   defining some configuration variables. Each package is identified by an ID, which is later referred to by the report
   directive. Here, the ID is called `src` (dictionary key). Each package needs 4 configuration entries:

   * `name` - Name of the Python package[^1].
   * `directory` - The directory of the package to analyze.
   * `fail_below` - An integer value in range 0..100, for when a documentation coverage is considered FAILED.
   * `levels` - A predefined color pallet name or a dictionary of coverage limits, their description and CSS style classes.

   ```Python
   # ==============================================================================
   # Sphinx-reports - DocCov
   # ==============================================================================
   report_doccov_packages = {
     "src": {
       "name":       "myPackage",
       "directory":  "../myPackage",
       "fail_below": 80,
       "levels":     "default"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Add the `doc-coverage` directive into your Restructured Text (ReST) document.
 
   * `packageid` - The ID used in `conf.py` to describe a Python package.

   ```ReST
   .. report:doc-coverage::
      :packageid: src
   ```

[^1]: Toplevel Python packages can reside in a directory not matching the package name. This is possible because the
